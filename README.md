# sanbox POC

## Which kind of isolation does it provide

- Linux namespaces: UTS (hostname), MOUNT (chroot), PID (separate PID tree), IPC, NET (separate networking context), USER, CGROUPS
- FS constraints: chroot(), pivot_root(), RO-remounting, custom /proc and tmpfs mount points
- Resource limits (wall-time/CPU time limits, VM/mem address space limits, etc.)
- Programmable seccomp-bpf syscall filters (through the kafel language)
- Cloned and isolated Ethernet interfaces
- Cgroups for memory and PID utilization control.


Examples:
- Run echo command once only, as a sub-process: `nsjail -Mo --chroot / -- /bin/echo "ABC"`
- Execute echo command directly, without a supervising process: `nsjail -Me --chroot / --disable_proc -- /bin/echo "ABC"`

## Building the docker

Base image for nsjail
`docker build . -t nsjail`

Playground image
`docker build -f Dockerfile.playground . -t playground`

how to run stuff inside testing docker:

`./run_interactive.sh`

Then you can run examples:

- With secomp filtering
`nsjail --chroot / -P /policy.kafel --config  /sandbox.cfg -- /opt/adaptive/venv/bin/python /examples/test_process_killing.py`

- `nsjail --chroot / --config  /sandbox.cfg -- python3 --version`
- `nsjail --chroot / --config  /sandbox.cfg -- python3 /examples/hello.py`
- `nsjail --chroot / --config  /sandbox.cfg -- /usr/bin/python3 -Su /examples/hello.py `

## Sandbox permissions

### System

**keep_caps: false** = Strip all capabilities from the sandboxed process
This means the sandboxed Python code runs with minimal privileges

### User

- üë§ Username: nobody
- üìù Real Name: Unknown
- üÜî User ID: 65534
- üë• Group ID: 65534

### Folders

- R/W permissions on `/data` dir mount, which is actually isolated for each sandbox run. This directory is the default pwd and user's HOME dir.
- /tmp dir with rw permissions, it's mounted to 'tmpfs', lives in RAM. So basically it goes off after sandbox execution end and each sandbox has own isolated temp dir

### Network

- Egress to internet is allowed
- No local IP

### Environment variables

list of inherited env vars from host:

- "WANDB_API_KEY"
- "HF_DATASETS_CACHE"
- "HF_HOME"
- "HF_TOKEN"

## Limits

- 2GB RAM
- 8GB maximum file size
- 8GB max size of data segment.
- 1024 simultaneously open file descriptors
- 100 processes running

## Processes

I actually chose to disable cgroup isolation, because it's already done by containers runtime (docker, containerd etc..).
cgroup isolation requires host container to have elevated previleges.

Actually this sandbox has much finer grained control over syscalls filtering which is much more powerful.

- No process termination: The sandboxed process cannot kill other processes on the system
- No signal injection: Cannot send arbitrary signals to other processes
- Reduced attack surface: Eliminates potential vectors for process manipulation
- Better isolation: Maintains the principle of least privilege

## TBD

- harden network access policy:
    - Only traffic to External Net
    - And traffic to harmony ws endpoint.
